- ⚡ Fun fact: The first computer mouse was made of wood. In 1964, Doug Engelbart invented the mouse as a pointing device for computers. The prototype was a simple wooden shell with two metal wheels - one for the X-axis and one for the Y-axis movement. It's come a long way from its humble beginnings to the sleek and ergonomic designs we use today! 🖱️✨
